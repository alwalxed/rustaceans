# Intro

**Presenter:** Muhammad  
**Rust Book:** https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

---

## Overview

- Who is Muhammad?
- What is Rust, and why does it matter?
- Why I personally want to learn Rust
- What I hope we build together as a group

---

## Who Am I?

- I'm **Muhammad**
- Software engineering graduate, and I now work as a frontend engineer
- I've mainly worked with JavaScript, with React as my framework of choice for
  developing web applications

---

## What is Rust?

- A memory-safe compiled systems programming language focused on three things:
  speed, safety, and concurrency
- The compiler is strict by design, it catches a ton of bugs before you run your
  code (think null pointers, dangling references, etc..)
- Used in: OS kernels, WebAssembly, game engines, CLI tools, embedded systems,
  and more

---

## Why I'm Learning Rust

- I want to go lower level, work more with embedded systems and hardware, and
  understanding how memory works and the underlying processes is something I've
  always been interested in but never properly got around to learning..
- I want to learn what it actually looks like to write software that is fast and
  correct, as working with JS doesn't teach much in that regard, and maybe dive
  later on in backend and distributed systems

## What I Expect From This Group

- A place to learn, share thoughts, and stay motivated
- For us as a group to help each other out, especially on complicated topics
